# 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Workshop (Google)

This repository contains the reference materials and quick-start scripts for the **5-Day Generative AI Intensive** workshop created by Google. It is organized to help you revisit each day’s theme, review the supporting guides, and experiment with starter code.

## Repository structure

- `22365_13_Solving Domain-Specific problems using LLMs_v7.pdf` – Day 1: domain-specific prompt design and retrieval strategies.
- `22365_14_Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI_v7 (1).pdf` – Day 2: deploying and scaling agents on Vertex AI.
- `22365_19_Agents_v8.pdf` – Day 3: building agentic workflows.
- `22365_3_Prompt Engineering_v7 (1).pdf` – Day 4: advanced prompt engineering techniques.
- `whitepaper_Foundational Large Language models & text generation_v2.pdf` – Day 5: foundational models, architecture, and safety considerations.
- `whitepaper_emebddings_vectorstores_v2.pdf` – Supporting whitepaper on embeddings and vector stores.
- `5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google Learn Guide - Kaggle_ - www.kaggle.com.pdf` – Companion learn guide from Kaggle.
- `hello.py` – A placeholder script you can extend while experimenting with the workshop content.
- `hell` – Empty placeholder, safe to ignore or remove once the repo is customized.

## Using this repository

1. Open the relevant PDF for the day/topic you want to revisit.
2. Leverage the `hello.py` script as a sandbox for testing prompts, integrations, or helper utilities. Rename or replace it as your project evolves.
3. Keep the whitepapers for deeper dives into model internals or vector search foundations.

## Tips

- Pair the Kaggle Learn Guide with the corresponding day’s PDF to reinforce the labs or exercises.
- Rename the skeleton files (`hello.py`, `hell`) as you add real code to keep the repo tidy.
- Use version control (git) to track your iterations if you start extending the materials.

Feel free to reach out if you want help turning this collection into a personal study project or deploying what you build.
